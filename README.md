# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Evan Valencia**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Free Game Generator** is an android app that **Allows users to find a random free game based on their platform
and game type using the FreeToGame API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: :space_invader: :joystick: :video_game:

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **platform and game type**
- [X] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- Header color changes with pic
- Displays if the query could not find any games 

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **FreeToGame**.

## Notes

I learned how to use the AsyncHTTPClient to make calls to an API and integrate it 
with my app. As well I learned how to use Glide to load pictures. The last thing I 
learned was how to use the pallete class to grab the dominant color in a picture.
